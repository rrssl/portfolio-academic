I am currently finishing my PhD at University College London, under the supervision of [Niloy J. Mitra](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/n.mitra/), [Marie-Paule Cani](https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/geovic/members/marie-paule_cani/) and [Jean-Claude Léon](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jean-Claude_Leon). I spent the first year of my PhD at Inria in the [IMAGINE team](https://team.inria.fr/imagine/), and 3 months at Adobe as a research intern (mentored by [Amanda Ghassaei](http://www.amandaghassaei.com/) and [Matt Fisher](https://techmatt.github.io/)). My research interests focus on computational design and fabrication methods applied to problems at the intersection of art and engineering.
